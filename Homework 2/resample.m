function [newParticles, newWeights] = resample( particles, weights)
% Given the current particles and weights, sample new particles and weights
% Use the low variance sampler from class.
% INPUTS:
%  particles    - current set of particles
%  weights      - weights for each particle
% 
% OUTPUTS:
% newParticles  - resampled particles (as many as the number of input
%                 particles)
% newWeights    - updated weights for the particles

% do some stuff here

% make sure to use the low variance sampler from class
